## Terms

The terms used in the Conformance Level information are defined as follows:

- **Supports**: The functionality of the product has at least one method that meets the criterion without known defects or meets with equivalent facilitation.
- **Partially Supports**: Some functionality of the product does not meet the criterion.
- **Does Not Support**: The majority of product functionality does not meet the criterion.
- **Not Applicable**: The criterion is not relevant to the product.
- **Not Evaluated**: The product has not been evaluated against the criterion. This can be used only in WCAG 2.0 Level AAA.

## WCAG 2.0 Report

Tables 1 and 2 also document conformance with:
- EN 301 549: Chapter 9 - Web, Chapter 10 - Non-Web documents, Section 11.2.1- Non-Web Software (excluding closed functionality), and Section 11.2.2 - Non-Web Software (closed functionality).
- Revised Section 508: Chapter 5 – 501.1 Scope, 504.2 Content Creation or Editing, and Chapter 6 – 602.3 Electronic Support Documentation.

**Note**: When reporting on conformance with the WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria, they are scoped for full pages, complete processes, and accessibility-supported ways of using technology as documented in the [WCAG 2.0 Conformance Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance-reqs).
