# Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)

This repository contains Voluntary Product Accessibility Template&reg; (VPAT&reg;) documents for Springer Nature products.

The VPAT is a template used to document a product's conformance with accessibility standards and guidelines. The purpose of the VPAT is to assist customers and buyers in making preliminary assessments regarding the availability of commercial "Electronic and Information Technology", also referred to as "Information and Communication Technology" (ICT) products and services with features that support accessibility.

> Documents in this repository will conform to VPAT&reg; `Version 1.0`, `Version 2.2` or the newer `Version 2.3`. **New documents in this repository should conform to the latest standard (2.3) using the template provided**

### VPAT&reg; Version 1.0

Voluntary Product Accessibility Template&reg; (VPAT&reg;) documents for Springer Nature products, outlining Section 508 accessibility information for Springer Nature products.

The first table of the Template provides a summary view of the Section 508 Standards. The subsequent tables provide more detailed views of each subsection.

There are three columns in each table. The first column of the Summary Table describes the subsections of subparts B and C of the Standards. The second describes the supporting features of the product or refers you to the corresponding detailed table, e.g. “equivalent facilitation”. The third contains any additional remarks and explanations regarding the product.

In the subsequent tables, the first column contains the lettered paragraphs of the subsections. The second column describes the supporting features of the product with regard to that paragraph. The third column contains any additional remarks and explanations regarding the product.
