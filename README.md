# Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)

This repository contains Voluntary Product Accessibility Template&reg; (VPAT&reg;) documents for Springer Nature products.

The VPAT is a template used to document a product's conformance with accessibility standards and guidelines. The purpose of the VPAT is to assist customers and buyers in making preliminary assessments regarding the availability of commercial "Electronic and Information Technology", also referred to as "Information and Communication Technology" (ICT) products and services with features that support accessibility.

## Creating a new VPAT

To create a new VPAT for a product, use a *copy* of the [base template](./base-template.md) as a starting point. Ensure that you update the following placeholders within your copied template:

- !INSERT PRODUCT!
- !INSERT PRODUCT NAME!  
- !INSERT PRODUCT DESCRIPTION!  
- !INSERT DATE LAST EDITED!  

then add your product to the list below.
